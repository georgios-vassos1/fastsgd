# An efficient implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedures for estimation with big data
This repository hosts a fast python library implementing stochastic
approximation methods for parameter estimation with large data sets. 

The traditional SGD and Implicit SGD methods, the latter presented in [[1]](#1), 
are both included to be used in the estimation of Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs), or in M-estimation.
